# Modern Front-End Starter Boilerplate

A modern front-end starter boilerplate made to use Gulp 4 for watching and compiling scss, es6 and other assets both for production (minified) as well as for development and live reloading to the browser. This is work in progress.

## Installation

You will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and `NPM` installed to get this running. Will eventually move this to a Yarn build maybe and etc.
Live-Server

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm run build
```

## To Do List (Ordered by Priority - Quick Draft)

* get html string literals from actual html files instead of in-file functions..
* envs
* gulp tasks (account for envs)
* webpack ?
